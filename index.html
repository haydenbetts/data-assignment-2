                        “There needs to be a design of a course called Opioid Funding 101,” said Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Board Chair Debra Pantin at a September 12th meeting of that body. Pantin's comment came after a nearly 10-minute discussion about one of the finer points of how the money is distributed from opioid manufacturers to counties in New York State. The advisory board has been meeting twice monthly for nearly two years.

                        The complexity of the scheme by which the $2.8 billion dollars the Attorney General won from companies involved in the manufacture and distribution of opioids in New York State moves from the state to agencies and municipalities that have discretion to spend the funds has made oversight difficult. According to Christine Minhee's <a href="https://www.opioidsettlementtracker.com/" target="_">Opioid Settlement Tracker</a>, a resource widely relied upon by activists in New York State, only 36.4% of settlment funds in New York State are subject to mandatory public reporting requirements.

                        In a phone interview with this publication, Alexis Pleus, the Executive Director of TruthPharm, who testifies frequently before the Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Board reflected on the transparency issues highlighted by the graphic above. "Even OASAS's funds, which are supposed to be the transparent ones, don't say how much each [grantee] organization was awarded. It’s like, ‘maximum grant $500,000.’ You can kind of guess at it, but they make it very hard to track." Pleus was even also emphatic about the probability of fund misuse at the county level "I looked at one county that spent a million dollars on home medication lockboxes. A million bucks. What the hell are they doing? It’s infuriating."
